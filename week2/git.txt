 - It exists in the .git directory and is divided into two.
 - Local Repository: Personal repository where files are stored on a personal PC
 - Remote Repository: A repository that is managed by a dedicated remote repository server and can be shared with multiple people
 
3) Index (Staging Area)
 - Preparation area before storing information from Working Directory to Repository
 - It is expressed as recording and staging the file status.
